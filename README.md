# PythonGUI_BankApp
This is normal bank application where user logs in with username and password and after successful login can perform basic operations such as adding payee, removing payee, deposit money, withdrawl of money and logout. When user performs the operations those must get reflected in the database accordingly. I have created two tables in the database one for account and other for payee. I created the forms using html and when user enters the data in the fields in the form that is retrieved by the python code and thus saving in the database(MYSQL).
